        <p>Costa Rica is a small but beautiful country in Central America, it's full of nature, color and peace. We're part of just 5% of the world's biodiversity. Plus, we don't have an army! We believe in peace, education and protecting the nature. That's why over 25% of our country is protected by national parks, wildlife refuges and reserves. Another fun fact is that around 95% of our electricity comes from renewable sources. Costa Rica is full of amazing beaches, volcanos and views... Costa Rica is "Pura Vida"!</p>
